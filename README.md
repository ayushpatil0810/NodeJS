# Node.js Learning Notes

This repository contains examples and notes on key Node.js concepts learned through practice.

## Topics Covered

### 1. File System Module (`fs_module/`)

The File System module in Node.js provides methods for interacting with the file system.

#### Key Methods Learned:
- **Reading Files**: `fs.readFileSync(path, encoding)` - Reads a file synchronously and returns its contents.
- **Writing Files**: `fs.writeFileSync(path, data, encoding)` - Writes data to a file, overwriting existing content.
- **Appending to Files**: `fs.appendFileSync(path, data, encoding)` - Appends data to the end of a file.
- **Creating Directories**: `fs.mkdirSync(path, options)` - Creates a directory. Use `{ recursive: true }` to create nested directories.
- **Removing Directories**: `fs.rmdirSync(path)` - Removes a directory (must be empty).
- **Deleting Files**: `fs.unlinkSync(path)` - Deletes a file.

#### Module Import Styles:
- **CommonJS**: `const fs = require('node:fs')`
- **ESM**: `import { readFileSync } from 'fs'`

### 2. Import and Require (`import_and_require/`)

Node.js supports two main module systems for importing code.

#### CommonJS (Traditional):
- Uses `require()` function to import modules
- Example: `const fs = require('node:fs')`

#### ES Modules (ESM) (Modern):
- Uses `import` statements
- Example: `import { readFileSync } from 'fs'`

### 3. Blocking vs Non-Blocking Code (`blocking_and_unblocking_code/`)

Node.js can handle operations in two ways: blocking (synchronous) and non-blocking (asynchronous).

#### Blocking (Synchronous) Code:
- Operations that block the execution thread until completed
- Example: `fs.readFileSync(path, encoding)` - The program waits for the file to be read before continuing
- Pros: Simple, predictable order
- Cons: Can make the application unresponsive for I/O operations

#### Non-Blocking (Asynchronous) Code:
- Operations that don't block the execution thread
- Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await
- Example: `fs.readFile(path, encoding, callback)` - The program continues executing, and the callback is called when the operation completes
- Pros: Better performance, doesn't block the event loop
- Cons: More complex, potential callback hell

## Running the Examples

Each folder contains an `index.js` file with example code. To run:

1. Navigate to the folder: `cd fs_module`, `cd import_and_require`, or `cd blocking_and_unblocking_code`
2. Run the script: `node index.js`

## Notes

- The `note.txt` files contain placeholder text.
- `package.json` files define the project dependencies and scripts.
- Temporary files like `tempCodeRunnerFile.js` are generated by the code runner and can be ignored.
